# Stress Detection Using EEG and ECG

## Introduction
This project continues previous work conducted by PhD students at INRIA on differentiating stress from physiological baselines using a data-driven approach. Building on their preprocessing pipeline and dataset, which includes mobile, simultaneous recordings of EEG and ECG under various stress elicitation and physical activity conditions, I will focus on enhancing the feature extraction process to improve model performance. Specifically, I aim to implement a weighted visibility graph method and extract additional frequency sub-band features, expanding upon the initial approach that used Limited Penetrable Visibility Graphs (LPVG) for frequency-based and shape-based feature extraction from adjacency matrix images.

## Dataset
This project uses a database of already preprocessed signals. The original multi-modal PASS database comes from: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.542934/full.

## Model
Ex. architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

## Results
Ex. visualizations, performance metrics, and analysis.
